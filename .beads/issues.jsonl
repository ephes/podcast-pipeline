Let me summarize my findings:\n\n**Bead podcast-pipeline-s2k.3 Review:**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:** \"Unit tests cover convergence, iteration limit, and sticky decision behavior (locked fields).\"\n\n**Findings:**\n\n1. **Implementation**: The review loop engine was implemented as a pure function in `src/podcast_pipeline/review_loop_engine.py` with:\n   - `run_review_loop_engine()` that runs creator/reviewer iterations\n   - Convergence detection (reviewer ok \u0026\u0026 creator done)\n   - Iteration limit → needs_human behavior  \n   - Locked fields / sticky decision support via `LoopDecision.locked_fields`\n   - Protocol JSON file outputs via `ProtocolWrite` objects\n\n2. **Tests**: Three unit tests in `tests/test_review_loop_engine.py`:\n   - `test_engine_converges_when_reviewer_ok_and_creator_done` - covers convergence\n   - `test_engine_stops_on_iteration_limit_with_needs_human` - covers iteration limit\n   - `test_engine_respects_locked_outcome_and_does_not_rerun` - covers sticky/locked behavior\n\n3. **Quality Gates**: The implementer log shows the initial run **failed** with `returncode=1` due to a C901 complexity lint error (`run_review_loop_engine is too complex (11 \u003e 10)`). However, the current code on disk shows the function was refactored (helper functions `_normalize_review_iteration`, `_terminal_decision`, `_decide_outcome` were extracted), suggesting a subsequent run may have fixed this.\n\n4. **Issue**: The \"Ready for review\" comment claims validation passed, but the log shows `returncode=1` with the lint failing at line 4886. The code appears to be fixed now, but there's no evidence in the logs that the quality gates passed after the refactor.\n\nChanges requested: The implementer log shows `returncode=1` with `just lint` failing (C901 complexity error).
