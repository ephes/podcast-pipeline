# podcast-pipeline

`podcast-pipeline` is an automated, multi-stage production pipeline that turns raw recordings and transcripts into reviewed episode copy, Auphonic outputs, and publish-ready assets.

## Development

Quality gates must pass before declaring work done:

```bash
uv sync
just lint
just typecheck
just test
```

## Docs

We use Sphinx with MyST Markdown. Preview locally with:

```bash
just docs
```

For a static build:

```bash
just docs-build
```

The preview runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and static output lands in `docs/_build/html/`.

## Local web UIs

`podcast dashboard` and `podcast pick --web` listen on `127.0.0.1` only and reject requests from other origins or
hostnames, and state-changing requests without `Content-Type: application/json`. Dashboard jobs such as Auphonic
production run single-flight per episode. Details: `docs/tutorials/episode-workflow.md` ("Local web UIs").

## Domain models

Core Pydantic models live in `podcast_pipeline.domain` and are intended to back `episode.yaml` + `state.json`.
