# This config is intended for running `beadsflow` against this repo.
#
# Key differences from the older approach:
# - Use `comment_mode = "stdout"` so beadsflow posts comments itself (keeps scripts simple and avoids huge comments).
# - Keep stdout comments short to prevent `.beads/issues.jsonl` lines from exceeding Beads' scanner limit.
#
# Note: `beads_no_db = true` is currently unreliable with our Beads CLI usage because `bd --no-db comment` writes to the
# sqlite db but does not immediately update `.beads/issues.jsonl`, so beadsflow fails to observe marker transitions.
#
# Note: this repo has multiple `podcast-pipeline-*` prefixes (hash-suffixed), so `bd --no-db` needs
# `BD_ISSUE_PREFIX=podcast-pipeline` in the environment (see `Justfile` helpers).
