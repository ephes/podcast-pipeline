## Update documentation

Use this checklist when shipping an epic or a significant feature:

- Place new content in the right Diataxis section (tutorials/how-to/reference/explanation).
- Add or update pages under `docs/` and keep the section toctree current.
- Preview locally with `just docs`, or build static HTML with `just docs-build`, and fix any broken links.
