# Episode workflow: init → ingest → draft → review → pick

This guide ties together the MVP pipeline steps for a single episode and shows where each step writes in the
workspace.

## 1. Initialize a workspace (init)

```bash
podcast init --episode-id ep_001 --workspace ./workspaces/ep_001
```

Notes:

- `--workspace` must not exist; the command creates it.
- If you omit `--workspace`, the default is `./episodes/<episode_id>`.

## 2. Export and transcribe audio

**Export a master mix** from Ultraschall/Reaper to MP3 first. The per-track FLAC files in the Reaper media folder are
not suitable for transcription — transcription tools expect a single mixed audio file.

```bash
# Transcribe using podcast-transcript (MLX backend, runs locally on Apple Silicon)
time uvx --from 'podcast-transcript[mlx]' transcribe \
  --backend mlx \
  /Users/jochen/Documents/REAPER\ Media/pp_068/pp_068.mp3
```

Notes:

- The transcript file (`.txt`) is what you pass to `podcast draft` in the next step.
- Transcripts are stored outside the workspace — by convention under `~/.podcast-transcripts/transcripts/pp_<NNN>/`.

## 3. Draft text assets (draft)

`podcast draft` runs the transcript chunking + summary + candidate generation pipeline. It reuses an existing workspace
if one is present (clearing stale chunks/summaries on re-run).

```bash
podcast draft \
  --workspace ./workspaces/ep_068 \
  --transcript ~/.podcast-transcripts/transcripts/pp_68/pp_68.txt \
  --episode-id ep_068 \
  --host Jochen --host Dominik \
  --candidates 3
```

The `--host` flag is repeatable and persists host names to `episode.yaml`. On subsequent runs without `--host`, the
stored names are reused automatically. Host names are injected into all LLM prompts (summarization and candidate
generation) to prevent hallucinated speaker names.

Outputs:

- `transcript/` contains the ingested transcript + chunk files.
- `summaries/` contains chunk summaries and the episode summary.
- `copy/candidates/<asset_id>/` contains candidate JSON + Markdown + HTML files.

## 4. Run the review loop (review)

```bash
podcast review \
  --workspace ./workspaces/ep_001 \
  --episode-id ep_001 \
  --asset-id description \
  --max-iterations 3
```

Notes:

- Add `--fake-runner` to use the built-in stub creator/reviewer.
- Review iterations are written under `copy/reviews/<asset_id>/` and protocol state under `copy/protocol/<asset_id>/`.
- When the loop converges, the selected draft is written to `copy/selected/<asset_id>.*`.

## 5. Pick final copy (pick)

```bash
# Web UI (recommended) — opens a browser for full-text side-by-side comparison
podcast pick --workspace ./workspaces/ep_001 --web

# CLI — interactive prompt with truncated previews
podcast pick --workspace ./workspaces/ep_001
```

Notes:

- `--web` opens a local web UI for full-text comparison of all candidates per asset. Select candidates by clicking, then
  press "Done" to shut down the server.
- Without `--web`, the CLI prompts when multiple candidates exist and writes the selection to `copy/selected/`.
- Use `--asset-id` and `--candidate-id` to pick a specific candidate non-interactively (CLI only).

## Copy/paste HTML into Wagtail

Use the HTML files produced by `podcast pick` (or by a converged review loop) when pasting into Wagtail RichText
fields.

1. Open `copy/selected/<asset_id>.html`.
2. In Wagtail, switch the RichText field to its HTML/source mode.
3. Paste the HTML and save.

The HTML is generated deterministically from Markdown and supports headings, paragraphs, lists, links, inline code, and
emphasis. If you need plain text, use the `.txt` output instead.
