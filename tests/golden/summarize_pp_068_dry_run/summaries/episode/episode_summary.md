## Key points

- 00:00:00 HOST: Welcome back to Podcast Pipeline. Today we're talking about making episode publishing boring—in a good way.
- 00:00:08 CO-HOST: The goal is simple: fewer manual steps, fewer copy/paste mistakes, and a repeatable process.
- 00:00:20 HOST: Let's start with the raw inputs. We usually have multitrack audio, a rough transcript, and some notes.
- 00:00:30 CO-HOST: And those inputs are messy. Speaker labels can be inconsistent, timestamps drift, and the text has filler words.
- 00:00:45 HOST: So we treat the transcript as an artifact, not as truth. It's a source for summaries and chapters.
