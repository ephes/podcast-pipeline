<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>00:00:00 HOST: Welcome back to Podcast Pipeline. Today we&#x27;re talking about making episode publishing boring—in a good way.</li>
<li>00:00:08 CO-HOST: The goal is simple: fewer manual steps, fewer copy/paste mistakes, and a repeatable process.</li>
<li>00:00:20 HOST: Let&#x27;s start with the raw inputs. We usually have multitrack audio, a rough transcript, and some notes.</li>
<li>00:00:30 CO-HOST: And those inputs are messy. Speaker labels can be inconsistent, timestamps drift, and the text has filler words.</li>
<li>00:00:45 HOST: So we treat the transcript as an artifact, not as truth. It&#x27;s a source for summaries and chapters.</li>
</ul>
